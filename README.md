# [Auto Roll](https://github.com/Aireeh/Weakauras-for-Ascension/blob/main/Auto%20Roll)
/!\Work in progress but mostly feature complete/!\ 

Tired of rolling for the same items over and over again?
Automatically rolls on a compiled list of items, or add items via name, id or link, so you don't get spammed with annoying roll pop-ups mid fight.
